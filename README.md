# Sociallord v0.0.1

**Sociallord** is a model of an social-app used by society of the future times.
Non-governmental, non-profit. Non-centralized control provided by block-chain.
It grants a simple and intuitive interface for managing social status to an **individual** connected.
This application is tend to be a helping sub-system for a global life-organisation-system of the future. Main goal is to aid the system to destroy current vertical structure of social control, which proves to be a nourishing substance for a full spectrum of parasitic social activity. **Sociallord** could potentially help people to get rid of inequality, xenophobia, false/parasitic attractors, time wasting, lack of justice and lying. It could boost efficiency of all of the humanity so it can bring prosperous life for each and every, closer.

**Sociallord** tracks all of **individual**'s social behavior data, such as:
- administrative/criminal **offences**;
- acts of good will, charity, common/general help - **actions**;
- redeeming actions - **redemption**;

**Sociallord** provides:
- perks and bonuses to those who care about society;
- ability to rate other individuals;
- ability to define the importance of actions;
- ability to define social-parasites and to judge their fate;
- ability to see all life-time actions of all of the individuals;
- ability to make noticeable impact on the local and global environment/infrastructure;

### Block-chain life-time
All actions is stored in a block-chain non-centralized database. Write once and read-only. This provides transparent non-editable mutual history, where each and every individual can see every action made by every other individual.

### Severity Level and Special Status
All of the **offences** have a severity level. The individual's negative rating is connected to this property.

If an individual commits a minor offence too many times (actual number of times is TBA) or if an individual's rating drops below certain warning-point the special **warning status** is given to this individual. Minor offences have no cumulative effect, thus no lower status is given.
**Warning status** creates special action inside the individual habitat area for other positive rated individuals. They are given opportunity to resolve this action and help low-rated individual to ascend. Redeemed individual is monitored by others after redemption for a designated amount of time.

If an individual commits a major **offence** the special **dangerous status** is given to this individual.
If an individual's rating drops below point of no return (if the **severity level** of the **offence**is too high) the special **dangerous status** is given to this individual.
**Dangerous status** creates special action inside the individual habitat area for other positive rated individuals. They are given opportunity to resolve this action by capturing dangerous individual. Redeemed individual is monitored by others after redemption for a designated amount of time.
The individual with this status must remand in custody until the proper verdict is given. Verdict is defined by all non-dangerous and non-warning signed individuals.
The severity of the verdict is yet unknown, but must include a separation form local and global community.



### Action Rating and Action Rating Multiplier
App provides the 10 points positive and negative rating scale for each **individual**. Base rating of an individual is "0". Rating is based on **individual**'s actions. The **action rating** (impact of each action) is set by every **individual** connected by **voting**.
The action rating is defined by the system based on action data. System rating and human rating provided separately. Overall rating based on it's combination.

The magnitude of each action is defined by an **action rating multiplier**. The action rating multiplier is calculated based on:
- current place of residence of an individual (to stimulate actions in the individual's habitat. The closer to local community, the higher the multiplier);
- overall rating of an individual committing an action (the higher the overall rating, the lower the multiplier);
- score given by other individuals witnessed/connected to an action. Score is calculated bases on their own rating;
- **action rating**;

### System's choice
When an **action** is started and no activity is present for at least 15 mins, the system will choose the one responsible for that action. The choice is pseudo-random. *More logic for the selection process is needed*.
